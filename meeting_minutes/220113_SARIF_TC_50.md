* Michael: There will be support to finalize the errata (technical writer)
* David: Checklist for finalizing errata is in github issue [Requirements to finalize the errata #509](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/509)

## 3.3 Review current state of ecosystem ongoing work

* Eddy:
  - Github capabilities for SARIF extensions for VS and VSCode
  - Improve Codeflows for tool (CodeQL)
  - New RTM version (RTM 6)
* Michael: Highlighted the impact of some of these improvements 

## 3.4 Any continued report/discussion on metrics

* ONGOING and tracked by Michael's action on the metrics / roadmap

## 3.6 Status of Wikipedia page

* ONGOING and David plans to provide until one of the two next meetings

## 3.7 Discuss end-to-end results management (including code insights protocol)

* Michael: Shortly mentions a risk from the differences in position sync of results and code locations in editors between VS (not available identically in VSCode)
* Michael: New format ideas popped up to enable copy and paste transfer from GitHub CodeQL results into editor extensions
* Michael: Ongoing internal discussion at Microsoft on fuzzing result transfer into extensions
* Michael: Ongoing activities around the Code Insights Protocol (CIP)
* Aditya: Offers support for the protocol to avoid duplication of efforts
* All discuss options for a result store
* Nathan: How does the envisaged result store handle static and dynamic analysis results
* All discuss options for including dynamic results in a result store and to access per CIP 
* Nathan: Shortly lists the typical activities and result types that his team performs and uses
* David: Suggests to maybe consider eclipse to provide diversity of extensions
* Paul: Suggests to be careful to decide on what "flavor" to target (as many vendors provide customized versions)
* Stefan: Proposes to approach JetBrains - as they e.g. offer [Qodana - a linter with SARIF output](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/qodana-sarif-output.html) 
* James: Maybe can present some of the Snyk tools in one of the next meetings
* James: Consuming SARIF files can be resource intensive in the current version due to the format chosen - are there plans to change that or how do other tools handle that?
* Michael: Mentions deferred reads and writes as well as compression (all code level solutions) exemplifying existing strategies used in the field to mitigate resource problems
* Michael: Sketches some of the plans and the ideas not continued in the course of the existing spec version
* Stefan: Is in favor of streamability but is afraid the resistance why we did design SARIF as a monolithic JSON object in the first place will be hard to overcome with chunked un-wrapped designs
* All continue discussion
