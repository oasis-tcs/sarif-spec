* David: Summarizes that we agreed to all review the documents and plan to ballot on the errata during the next weeks 

## 3.3 Review current state of ecosystem ongoing work

* Eddy: Reported on activities and especially shared the information that Dot.net team also has a SARIF tool: the [Upgrade Assistant tool](https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant)
* Eddy: Many teams look out for tools to transform SARIF into HTML
* Michael: Any new OSS public SARIF extensions?
* Eddy: Will open a PR on Davids repository (for the Wikipedia page)
* Michael: Do not forget the Pysa tool mentioned by Paul
* Michael: Regarding HTML viewers mentions the link to [Viewers](https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/#Viewers) e.g. for supporting compliance reports
* Eddy: Mentions the [Heimdal tool](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org) and will provide further info
* Michael: Github interested in connecting to the SARIF aggregated store (in use at Microsoft) via VSCode
* Michael: Any other tools where connections to any sort of collector store are useful (like to a Sonar Cube store)
* Michael: Suggests agenda item for next meeting like Connections to Result Management Systems
* David: Eddy has provided further input to the Wikipedia article and expects to have that ready for review by next meeting

## 3.4 Metrics: review CodeQL metrics design, and overall design strategy

* Michael: Trying to join forces with other mebers to start a combined concept in December
* All discuss on if metrics or metricDescriptors should be used as name and if a new table is needed for metrics 
* Paul: Some prefer measures over metrics as term (MISRA)
* All: Suggest to stick with metrics as term (no compelling case made against it)
* Michael: Walks the participants through the SARIF schema to inspect if the mappings in existence already might be a good fit
* Michael: Tool defined ruleTaxonomies might need adding
* Michael: Asks if we should look at the Object Management Group's (OMG) Structured Metrics Metamodel ([SMM](https://www.omg.org/spec/SMM/)), specifically [Structured Metrics Metamodel (SMM(tm)) Version 1.2](https://www.omg.org/spec/SMM/1.2/PDF)

## 3.5 Review proposal for what's in- and out-of-scope. General discussion

* Michael: Reviewing extensions that add to but do not break anything target version 2.2
* Michael: Metrics extension also not breaking
* Michael: There is a detailed list of topics / candidates but no complete clarity yet what of these ar in or out of scope
* Michael: Suggested strategy is to describe the areas and collaborate with subject matter experts to derive the scope decisions
* Michael: Code coverage and fuzzing may go well together, but both topics are "deep" and question will be where constraints are needed
* Michael: Results management is also requested by others (like GitHub)
* Michael: Java-SDK together with MicroFocus
* Michael: Revamping of CWE - how to interface / combine / support
