# SARIF
The **Static Analysis Results Interchange Format** (**SARIF**; pronunciation_guide) is a universal representation for the output of [static analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_analysis) tools.  It is standardized by the [OASIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OASIS_(organization)) [SARIF Technical Committee](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=sarif).

## Purpose
SARIF creates one common format for representing the results of static analysis tools. This allows visualization tools to work with static analysis tools from multiple vendors. It also facilitates the aggregation of static analysis output from the tools of multiple vendors.

Each static analysis tool has a unique approach to discovering properties of computer program source code. Consequently, tools from different vendors find different sets of vulnerabilities. Combining the output of tools from multiple vendors can provide a more complete picture of vulnerabilities in source code.

By supporting SARIF, a low-cost tool provider gets access to a rich ecosystem of support.

## Standard
The current version of the standard, v2.1.0, is [publicly available from OASIS](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html).

### How SARIF relates to other standards
The [Object Management Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Management_Group)'s Tools Output Integration Format (TOIF)<sup>\[3\]</sup> is a standard that integrates diverse static analysis result formats into the lowest common denominator representation, as one form of evidence in a software assurance system.  By contrast, SARIF accommodates deep, precise expression of static analysis results to provide full support for the capabilities of advanced static analysis systems, enabling the sharing of sophisticated visualization and processing components that previously were specific to individual static analysis tools.

The Structured Threat Information eXchange (STIX)<sup>\[4\]</sup> standardized by the [OASIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OASIS_(organization)) Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Technical Committee<sup>\[5\]</sup> expresses more general cyber threat information and is not specific to source code analysis.  Since its focus is wider, it is not designed to include the full static analysis capabilities that SARIF provides.

## History
Early work on SARIF began within Microsoft for use in their tools. It eventually became apparent that SARIF's value could be substantially enhanced by making it an industry-wide standard.

The OASIS SARIF Technical Committee was formed and had its first meeting in September, 2017. The first edition of the OASIS SARIF standard was published in March, 2020. It was called version 2.1.0 in recognition of the earlier efforts within Microsoft as well as intermediate pre-standard versions that were in use during the development of the standard. Following publication, the committee suspended its activities, resuming beginning in March, 2021, to begin discussing the direction for future editions of the standard.
