<h2>Current Plan</h2>
<p>The current plan is to advance SARIF v2.1.0 to OASIS Standard.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>60-day public comment period for Candidate OASIS Standard (concludes 2020-02-18)</li>
<li>Address any comments received from the comment period (non-material changes only)</li>
<li>Hold an e-ballot to approve the changes and ask for a Call for Consent for OASIS Standard</li>
<li>Call for Consent (approx. three weeks for admin plus vote)</li>
<li>If no objections are received, publication of OASIS Standard (approx. 7 weeks after step 1 ends)</li>
</ol>
<p>If all goes well, we should be able to publish by early April, 2020.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Potential Future Plans</h2>
<ul>
<li>Publish Errata or a new SARIF v2.1.1 to address any material changes deemed necessary</li>
<li>Consider whether to address dynamic analisis, and if so, whether it should be part of SARIF or a separate standard</li>
</ul>
