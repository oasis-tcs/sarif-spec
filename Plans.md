<h2>Current Plan</h2>
<p>The current plan is to advance SARIF v2.1.0 to OASIS Standard.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>As of 2019-12-02, a 7-day ballot is in progress to approve the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Certification by the TC that all schema and XML instances are well-formed and that expressions are valid</li>
<li>Approval of the descriptive and compare/contrast paragraphs</li>
<li>Approval of the Statements of Use</li>
<li>Request for Special Majority Vote to proceed to Candidate OASIS Standard</li>
</ul>
<p>Further steps after that are as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Special Majority Vote for Candidate OASIS Standard (approx. 2 weeks for the administration plus the vote)</li>
<li>60-day public comment period for Candidate OASIS Standard</li>
<li>Address any comments received from the comment period (non-material changes only)</li>
<li>Hold an e-ballot to approve the changes and ask for a Call for Consent for OASIS Standard</li>
<li>Call for Consent (approx. three weeks for admin plus vote)</li>
<li>If no objections are received, publication of OASIS Standard (approx. 17 weeks after step 1 starts)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Potential Future Plans</h2>
<ul>
<li>Publish Errata or a new SARIF v2.1.1 to address any material changes deemed necessary</li>
<li>Consider whether to address dynamic analisis, and if so, whether it should be part of SARIF or a separate standard</li>
</ul>
