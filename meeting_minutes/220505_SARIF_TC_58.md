# 3. Discussion

## 3.1 Review recruitment effort to complete the technical committee

* David: Recruitement going well; another meeting with new prospective members upcoming
* David: There will be an official OASIS news release announcing some of our new members

## 3.2 Review status on finalizing SARIF 2.1 errata [List of next steps - github issue #509](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/509)

* All discuss the status of review and clarify the nature of the received feedback
* David: Plans are to send out next week and conduct a one week email ballot to then trigger the public review process
* David: In case the edits take longer we will vote on the next meeting

## 3.3 Review current state of ecosystem ongoing work

* Chris: 
  * New Visual Studio extension version published
  * New linters added and additional linters considered
* Michael: [Quality domain agnostic regular expression pattern matcher that persists results to SARIF](https://github.com/microsoft/sarif-pattern-matcher)

## 3.4 Any continued report/discussion on metrics

* Awaiting discussion between Michael and Paul

## 3.5 Discussion of updates to SARIF web site [https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/](https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/)

* Chris: Walks all through the sections of the SARIF web site / landing page at [https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/](https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/)
* All discuss the scope of the website
* Michael: Clarifies that Microsoft maintains the site, but the intent is to offer any available tool / resource
* Chris: There are already non-microsoft resources present on the site
* Michael: Suggests revisiting the approach / scope of the site offering - site was finished four years ago and new contributors to the TC might provide fresh ideas.
* Chris: Encourages everyone to provide feedback
* Michael: Provides https://reproducible-builds.org as food for thought
* Jeff: Suggests there should be ideally a single info source for all things SARIF
* Stefan: Mentions https://csaf.io as another example from the OASIS CSAF TC
* Jonathan: Contarst Security OSS tools could be integrated like [POJOs generated from the Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF) JSON schema.](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/java-sarif)

## 3.6 Review outcomes of MSFT/ForAllSecure dynamic analysis discussion

* Michael: 
  * Report from the meeting / discussions
  * Walks all through his notes
    * Key principles for dynamic analysis
    * Problems for supporting data from dynamic results
* Jeff:
  * Static vs. dynamic analysis results are just different perspectives focusing on the same finding (blending linear and hierarchical approaches)
  * There should be a way (ideally) to bring both perspectives together in SARIF - maybe the tools could bring in ideas
  * Great use case could be test / re-test - keeping maximal context (state) to be able to immediately share that information within the test case executing
    * Works best with end-to-end tests - but in general no need to exploit vulnerabilities to bring value to the developer
* Thanassis: 
  * embraces the sketched approaches to exploration of extending SARIF to dynamic analysis
  * additional complexity comes from combining test results from different scopes but if successful that may boost developers fixing velocity and increase coverage
  * what about reproducibility?
* David:
  * (w.r.t.) naming to widen the scope as embraced by the members of the TC is possible no recharter is needed (only clarification)
  * Perspective is static transforming into software term
  * Acronym SARIF can stay
* Michael: Provides link to debug assistance within the .Net context as example: [Diagnose Errors with Managed Debugging Assistants - 2022-MAR-11](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/debug-trace-profile/diagnosing-errors-with-managed-debugging-assistants)
* Stefan: The current plan from previous meetings is to explore the name evolution after the errata publication

## 3.7 Status of Wikipedia page

* Ongoing

## 3.8 Discuss end-to-end results management (including code insights protocol)

* Skipped

## 3.9 Vote on liaison with OpenSSF [https://openssf.org](https://openssf.org/)

* David: 
  * Shortly summarizes the rationale for and modes of liaisons
  * OpenSSF has asked OASIS if there is interest inside the SARIF TC for entering a liaison
  * Suggests to vote on our side if there is sufficient interest, next OpenSSF will vote on their side
  * In case there is sufficient interest the TC should vote on who and how that liaison should be implemented.

Jeff moves to enter a liaison relationship with OpenSSF. Michael seconds.
All discuss the motion.
No further discussion, no objection, unanimous consent. The motion carries.

David: Vote for entering the liaison relationship. 
Result of vote: 8 in favor, 0 against, 0 abstain.
Vote in favor of the relationship, so the SARIF TC will enter such a relationship.

Discussion on candiate for representing the liaison:

* Michael: 
  * Michael Scovetta is the Microsoft representative for the OpenSSF Alpha-Omega project.
  * Michael Fanning might be able to take on that role in case the OpenSSF meeting frequency would be feasible for him
* David: Small liaison group may be positive (more robust) while a larg group may become counter productive.
* Thanassis: ForAllSecure as company might be able to help

David: Next meeting we will vote on who this liaison shall be.
