# 3. Discussion

## 3.1 Review current state of ecosystem ongoing work

### 3.1.1 Related activities (OPENSSF, etc.)

1. SARIF activies on gcc (David Malcolm). Tracking under [SARIF](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SARIF). Posted a patch for kit diagnostics - moving gcc's diagnostic code into a library so that other projects can benefit from SARIF support. Adding support elsewhere becomes as simple as a single line. Emitting SARIF gcc-compatible diagnostics is equally simple. Hoping support may be released within the next year. GCC diagnoristics are supposed to have embedded URLs in them - filed three bugs in the sarif-spec tracker on issues that were encountered. Attempting to add SARIF support to gnu assembler / linker. Valgrind may consider adding support. Discussion on dynamic tools relying on jsonl (newline delimited json) and streaming to allow partial emission of results.

2. Question on CVE findings from SCA tools (Thanassis Avgerinos). Lack of consistency among SARIF reports produced by different tools is creating aggregation difficulties. The team sees no immediate solution to this.

### 3.1.2 Other Ecosystem Items

* ...

## 3.2 Review outcomes of subgroup discussions

...

## 3.3 Discuss the list of small non-breaking changes for SARIF v2.2

### 3.3.1 Editor's report

The merged editor revision from 2024-08-08 has been tagged as:

* [sarif-v2.2-wd20240808-dev](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/tree/sarif-v2.2-wd20240808-dev)
* [2.2-prerelease-2024-08-08](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/tree/2.2-prerelease-2024-08-08)

The latter tag shall support implementers and their users to best blend into semantic version schemes in use and relate implementations to the claimed specification (drafts).
Cf. [minutes of TC meeting 2024-08-08](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/blob/main/meeting_minutes/240808_SARIF_TC_90.md#333-additional-discussion)

One or more reported issues / questions have been tagged for discussion within the TC:

* [Clarify use (or extend design) of SARIF to express hierarchical diagnostics. #572](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/572) reported by Michael Fanning in 2023
  * discussion started already during [TC meeting 2024-08-08](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/blob/main/meeting_minutes/240808_SARIF_TC_90.md#312-other-ecosystem-items)
* [RFE: support for capturing chains of macro expansions? #650](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/650https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/650) reported by David Malcolm
* [Is any escaping of URIs within "3.11.6 Messages with embedded links" needed? #657](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/657) reported by David Malcolm

One of the editors is on leave of absence.

### 3.3.2 Approval of changes

* ...

### 3.3.3 Additional discussion

* Extended discussion on [expressing hierarchical diagnostics](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/572) between David Malcolm, Nathan Baird and Aditya Sharad on whether using graph and graph traveral is appropriate to represent them. Not possible to use arbitrary markup in some cases.

* Discussion on [macro expansions](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/650) - adding a new location relationship seemed to be useful. Unclear if the graph approach resolves here. Decided to postpone discussion to next meeting.

* Discussion on embedded links [1](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/656) [2](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/657) [3](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/658). Agreed on typo in issue !656 and get it deployed in 2.2.0. Will probably close !657. Discussion on !658 may be part of 2.2.0.

* Discussion on [sourceLanguage property](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/654) for SARIF itself. Decided to change to "sarif" for 2.2.0.
