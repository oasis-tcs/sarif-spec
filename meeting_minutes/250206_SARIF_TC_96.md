# 3. Discussion

## 3.1 Announce

> OASIS 2-year chair reappointment process

- David Keaton: 
  - Will send an email to the TC list asking for candidates for Chair / Co-chair positions.
  - Shows everyone the suggested text per TC process documentation.

## 3.2 Review current state of ecosystem ongoing work

### 3.2.1 Related activities (OPENSSF, etc.)

- Charles: Suggests that IETF [dCBOR - A Deterministic CBOR Application Profile](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/)
  might support use cases for SARIF files with heterogenously scoped parts
  and still being able to maintain attestation.
- All discuss.
- Nathan:
  - There would definitely be use for something like this (at least within Microsoft's use case).
  - Within Microsoft, many processors/producers have custom parameterization to produce or not produce redacted data in various sections.
- Stefan: Thinks this is interesting for complete subtrees but not so much for insulating SARIF findings from the triggering source code.
- David Malcolm: Do people actually use CBOR instead of JSON for SARIF like uses?

### 3.2.2 Other Ecosystem Items

- Davied Malcolm: COntinued to work on gcc SARIF plugin but provided no new patches yet.

## 3.3 Review outcomes of subgroup discussions

* No editor meeting and no new editor revision for this month.
* No other subgroup discussions.

## 3.4 Discuss the list of small non-breaking changes for SARIF v2.2

### 3.4.1 Editor's report

- Proposal from [Suggestions for more threadFlowLocation "kinds" property values #530](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/530)
  implemented in pull request [Editor Proposal for 530 Thread Flow Location Additions #671](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/pull/671).
- Text for [Consider adding bucketized 'justification' field for suppression object. #574](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/574)
  provided in pull request [Editor Proposal for 574 adding a justification enumeration #672](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/pull/672).
- Fix for issue [JSON example in logicalLocation.kind property (para 3.33.7) is invalid #670](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/670)
  provided in pull request [Editorial Proposal to Fix JSON Example for logicalLocation/kind #673](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/pull/673).

### 3.4.2 Approval of changes

- Pull request [Editor Proposal for 530 Thread Flow Location Additions #671](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/pull/671)
  - David Malcolm moves to approve and merge that minimal proposal. 
    - Stefan seconds. 
      - No objections, no further discussions, and unanimous consent. 
        - The motion carries.
- Pull request [Editorial Proposal to Fix JSON Example for logicalLocation/kind #673](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/pull/673).
  - Stefan moves to approve and merge that fix. 
    - David Malcolm seconds.
      - No objections, no further discussions, and unanimous consent.
        - The motion carries.

### 3.4.3 Additional discussion

- Discussion on proposal from [Suggestions for more threadFlowLocation "kinds" property values #530](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/530)
  implemented in pull request [Editor Proposal for 530 Thread Flow Location Additions #671](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/pull/671)
  - Nathan: 'falsepositive' is definitely another option, perhaps unique from my presumption of it trying to cover 'nondeterminism'
      (post-work via GitHub and email)
  - Charles: Why is kinds plural?
  - Stefan: It is a container (array) and we cannot rename fields in the v2.2 changes
    (as these break existing code expecting values under the old names).
- Discussion on Text for [Consider adding bucketized 'justification' field for suppression object. #574](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/574)
  provided in pull request [Editor Proposal for 574 adding a justification enumeration #672](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/pull/672).
  - Charles: Why not rename existing justrification field in justificationMessage or similar to
    better fit side by side with the new justificationType?
  - Stefan: We cannot rename fields in the v2.2 changes but can be a v3.0 change
    (as these break existing code expecting values under the old names).
  - Approval deferred when content from ticket (explanations) is added too.
- Discussion on fix for issue [JSON example in logicalLocation.kind property (para 3.33.7) is invalid #670](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/670)
  provided in pull request [Editorial Proposal to Fix JSON Example for logicalLocation/kind #673](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/pull/673).
- Discussion on the question / bug report from David Malcolm in 
  issue [Mismatching "fullyQualifiedName" in XML example in logicalLocation.kind property (§3.33.7) #669](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/669).
  - David Malcolm: States his interpretation of the SARIF v2.1.0 spec related to the XML example.
  - Charles: We should have all examples verified.
  - Stefan:
    - Did this already on JSON level for all SARIF v2.1.0 examples when translating from the Word document to markdown.
    - Comparing examples between v2.1.0 and v2.2 candidate showed many required fixes.
    - Extracted these prior existing examples into JSON files.
    - Sees this task as important for adoption of the standard, but we can provide a vetted example suite per
      the TC repository while and after progression of the specification.
  - David Malcolm:
    - Started a collection of such examples for (positive and negative) tests to support his development of the gcc SARIF plugin
      available at <https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=tree;f=gcc/testsuite/sarif-replay.dg;hb=HEAD>.
