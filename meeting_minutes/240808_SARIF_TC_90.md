### 3.3.1 Editor's report

Created 1 pull request to provide the editor revision 2024-08-08 containing the merged 5 PRs from previous TC meeting 2024-07-11.

From the description of the PR [652](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/pull/652):

>Until this PR is merged, the user facing delivery items are inspectable directly in the source branch. Example markdown single file: https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/blob/editor-revision-2024-08-08/sarif-2.2/prose/share/sarif-v2.2-draft.md#informative-revision-history.
>
>The self-contained single-file HTML delivery item can be downloaded per  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/editor-revision-2024-08-08/sarif-2.2/prose/share/sarif-v2.2-draft.html and then opened locally in the browser to see the rendering.
>
>--- 
>The main goal of this change set is to bundle the prior 5 implemented proposals into a single editor revision.
>
>The approved and merged proposals included are:
>
>- Added guid property for root level log (#483) (#641)
>  - Added guid property for root level log (#483)
>  - Added the guid member to the root level object in the schema
>    (thanks to Kalle Olavi Niemitalo for reminding)
>  - Softened the compliance level to SHOULD as a compromise
>    to mitigate the impact on slow adapters.
>- Added related locations property (#491) (#643)
>- Implemented expiry date utc example additions (#492) (#644)
>- Defined a scanned file role (#459) (#642)
>- Fixed #634 duplicated notes enumeration (#640)
>
>Another important content addition is the addition of an adapted (v2.1.0 &rightarrow; v2.2) schema for external file properties, which was missing in the v2.2 tree.
>
>Next, the removal of the intermediate v2.1.0-errata-01 SARIF schema from the v2.2 tree.
>
>Final editorial goals were to upgrade frontmatter, acknowledgement and change log sections to:
>
>- describe the targeted CSD01 of v2.2 and not the former v2.1.0 errata 01
>- provide accurate coordinates (names, email addresses, and affiliations to match the roster)
>- name active editors
>- accurately propose acknowledgments for
>  - the real contributions to the current v2.2 work products
>  - the support provided in transforming from OfficeXML to markdown
>  - the support provided for the first two editor revisions
>  - the contributions to the previous v2.1.0 version we started from
>- provide a meaningful change log only listing editor revisions of v2.2 with links to implemented proposals

In addition, the editors worked on freshly reported issues and communicated with the members of the general public that provided comments. 

Unfortunately no further proposal was ready to implement directly.

One of the editors had availability problems for three weeks, which further reduced the achievable changes.
