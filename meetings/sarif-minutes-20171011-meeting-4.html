<h3 id="6.2">6.2 Face-to-face meeting</h3>
<pre>
January 22-23 (tentative)
</pre>
<h2 id="7">7. Document review</h2>
<h2 id="7.1">7.1 Accouncements</h2>
<p>Michael: went through lots of issues and merged in the notes and updated the status of some</p>
<p>Michael: reports of a "bucket-bug" #48 <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/48" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/48</a></p>
<p>Michael: reports source control repository rendering is still in analysis and kindly asks for Atlasssian experts to check back</p>
<p>Michael: Proposal on fingerprinting and asks members to collaborate on this one</p>
<p>Michael reports from newly raised issues: metrics on log files - should the format be location focused? Proposal only touch this to leave time for the discussion on the issue Henny raised</p>

<h3 id="7.2">7.2 Issue 33 - <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/33" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/33</a> - Should we allow formatting in messages?</h3>

<p>Laurence: walks all through a summary of the issue<br>
In markdown all dialogs are depending on the security of the processor, as all somehow allow embedding any HTML</p>
<p>Laurence: proposal to adopt github flavoured markdown</p>
<p>Laurence: offers to share <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/blob/master/Documents/ChangeDrafts/sarif-v1.0-issue-33-gfm.docx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/blob/master/Documents/ChangeDrafts/sarif-v1.0-issue-33-gfm.docx</a> especially section  3.10.3</p>
<p>All discuss</p>
<p>Luke asks on 3.10.1 in proposed draft topic inline links and brief messages</p>
<p>All discuss briefness vs. richness</p>
<p>Michael: suggests to take the discussion offline</p>
<p>Paul: comments on substitution strings. Is the intention that the string substituted may also contain markup?</p>
<p>Laurence: states, that this was not the original intention</p>
<p>All discuss</p>
<p>Paul understands, that the substitution itself should not contain markdown</p>
<p>Michael: suggests the agreement might be, t ensure the injected strings must be validated as not exposing side effects (sanitised input)</p>
<p>All discuss further on the proposal and already specified aspects in the spec</p>
<p>Jim asks how to distinguish regular and format message in proposal</p>
<p>All discuss the options</p>
<p>Stefan suggests to in JSON not show keys that carry no values, so if we have future ideas, we should insert keys for them in the future and not now (sample mime-type)</p>
<p>Henny: describes the issue she raised and the proposal - Context level property</p>
<p>Paul:</p>
<pre>
It's just that my version of the document doesn't have a 5.17.4, but section 3.17.4 seems to be the right one, 
so I'm wondering if I'm looking at the same thing everyone else is. 
I'm looking at the two versions I just downloaded - the one with the taxonomies changes, and the other with the gfm changes.
</pre>
<p>Laurence: Explains that section under discussion is 3.17.4 (not 5.17.4). Explanation:</p>
<pre>
The original HTML-based spec was written to mimic the ISO template. 
When I re-cast it into .docx in the OASIS template, the section numbers changed.
Presumably Henny was looking at the HTML version.
</pre>
<p>Laurence: asks the values in the tools considered if they are related to other ones or are a distinct dimension</p>
<p>Henny: states that these do not correlate to warnings etc. because e.g. a value like safe is an immediate tool result without interpretation or scoring.</p>
<p>All discuss</p>
<p>Mel is concerned about leaking implementation details when using specific tool labels, but instead use proposed namespace policies, as e.g. did code could be a policy</p>
<p>Discussion continues</p>
<p>All discuss on namespace proposal and level / poly space forward slash structuring options</p>
<p>Michael: will create a new issue to continue the conversation</p>
<p>Henny: will suggest some polyspace specific terms so we can start from there</p>

<h3 id="7.3">7.3 Issue 56 - <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/56" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/56</a> - Consider adding namespaces to tags</h3>

<p>Luke: reports that with their products, the rules are already tagged and it works pretty well</p>
<p>Jim: asks if the dash in the displayed samples means something.</p>
<p>Laurence responds that no.</p>
<p>All discuss how tags may be mapped to other tags</p>
<p>Paul and Michael discuss</p>
<p>Laurence: asks if the proposal for taxonomy might be a good alternative to the namespace/tags and level proposals</p>
<p>Laurence: sent the taxonomies proposal in response to issue #3</p>
<p>Michael: has issues with this proposal</p>
<p>All discuss taxonomies and multiplicities</p>
