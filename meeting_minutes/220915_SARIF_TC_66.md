  * No news

# 4. Discussion

## 4.1 Review status on finalizing SARIF 2.1 errata [List of next steps - github issue #509](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/509)

* David: It seems we are really close to the end and review together with Michael is pending to finalize hand-over to OASIS

## 4.2 Review current state of ecosystem ongoing work

* Mary: Shows two demo videos introducing:
  * Github Code Spaces and Code Scanning Integraion
  * Collaboration of the Visual C++ Team to enhance the SARIF viewer in Visual Studio
* Michael: Shows a demo video about GrammaTech CodeSonar SARIF VS Code extension interworking

## 4.3 Discussion of updates to SARIF web site [https://www.sarif.info](https://www.sarif.info)

* Mary: Build pipeline updates
* All: No need to keep this item on the agenda
* Pavel: Links of install buttons may need updates

## 4.4 SARIF's relationship with other relevant standards

* Michael: Reports on identified topics from the subgroup meeting
  * Transport protocol
  * File fuzzing
  * Open Telemetry
  * Microsoft internal formats (feedback from sources pending)
  * Software Bill of Materials (SBOM like CycloneDX, SPDX, and SWID)
* Stefan: List reads good, best to analyze early what we can include and where to only offer least intrusive extension points
* Michael:
  * Agrees to not disrupt the existing format too much without clear benefits for existing and new users of SARIF
  * What does fit in our "property bag" approach
* Jeff:
  * Updates to SARIF provides currently good list of problems
  * SBOM approaches organize around components providing different perspectives with massive referencing
    * Without balancing the impact i.e. not making a more comprehensible information item
      * Interpretability degrades when unweighted external references grow in numbers
  * Suggests a more balanced approach that adds evidence only when increasing the comprehensibility
* Stefan: 
  * Not convinced if SBOMs or Security Advisories will contain SARIF data but instead will point to public reports (CVEs) as SARIF is more for intermediate states.
  * CVEs may reference SARIF data to prove the point they make (similarly to Proof of concepts)
* Aditya:
  * Supply chain analysis cannot be run in isolation
    * SARIF is important for the consumer but who would produce the SARIF
* Nathan:
  * This is what his team provides as a service coming out of crashes (producers)
  * Is a SARIF log only about the errors we find or can it deliver assurance like 
    * pass documentation and 
    * "open" (inconclusiveness - it is present but do people use it?) indication
* Michael: Positive and negative evidence should be interesting
* Stefan: Positive evidence - really feasible?
* Thanassis: Positive evidence is not feasible (in general) but huge value to provide clear (comprehensible) reports
* Aditya: Yes, comprehensibility is a frequent request from the code scanning customers
* David: Suggests to continue this interesting discussion next time

## 4.5 Roadmap review

* Deferred to next time

## 4.6 Review outcomes of subgroup discussions
