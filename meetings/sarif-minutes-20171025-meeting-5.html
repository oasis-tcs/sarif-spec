<p>Michael: Editors went through the issues</p>

<p>Michael: Summarizes the current status of evaluation and alternative proposals for link embedding</p>
<p>Michael: asks if we can drop the markdown support, or objections?</p>
<p>Laurence: supports this. He wants to state, that JSON Schema might support the message format option in the future via this mechanism</p>
<p>Laurence: Example of proposed embedded link format from Change Draft:
<p>Laurence: </p>
<pre>
"results": [
  {
    "ruleId": "JS1012",
    "fullMessage": "Tainted data was introduced [here](Input.js(15,9,16,13))."
  }
]
</pre>
<p>Paul: is not much in favor of dropping</p>
<p>Paul: would like to retain some formating aspects, to not lose benefit offered in tools (readability)</p>
<p>Michael: tries to balance benefits and risks for other users (enforcement to support)</p>
<p>Paul: notes, that he would have to write an exporter twice (for formated and unformated one)</p>
<p>All discuss the issue</p>
<p>Paul: states, that at least keeping bullet points would leave him less unhappy</p>
<p>Laurence: reminds everyone, that markdown was also designed the way it is, as it looks ok unrendered and asks for additional details from Pauls use cases</p>
<p>Paul: had a custom XML dialect for the markup (like subscripts etc.) and he would be able to share</p>
<p>Michael: would be interested in seeing this dialect</p>
<p>Jim: thinks some kind of markup would be useful</p>
<p>Jim: mentions, that this should allow easy separation of categories</p>
<p>All discuss</p>
<p>Jim: would like to have a three level info triple as code (up to 8 characters long, than about 100 characters long than for e.g. beginner programmer unconstrained length info like e.g. 2 pages rendered on SQL injection ... so a power analyst can easily go over thousands of results, without being distracted by repetitive text</p>
<p>All continue to discuss in the light of SARIF design principles</p>
<p>Yekatarina: explains, that fortify does similar things to what Paul Anderson described on his tool set. Both have very limited markup, like formatting bold italics etc and links. They even do this for the abstract with replacement tags to make it easier to use</p>
<p>Yekaterina: Fortify also has custom markup (limited set of HTML tags) together with "placeholders" (variables, links)</p>
<p>Michael: kindly requests if Yekatarina could share some documentation (esp. on the placeholders) so we can consider this in analysis</p>
<p>All discuss</p>
<p>Michael: wonders, if a fairly substantive report that uses the full set of markup tags from Yekatarina and Paul so the TC can analyse and make suggestiosn for a subset</p>
<p>Paul: substitution is done on their tool when the warning is rendered, right? Yekatarina approves this understanding</p>
<p>All agree, that display of formatted info based on SARIF will always be harder than in the native tool</p>
<p>Laurence: if linkback from sarif to native source report would be possible, that would be optimal</p>
<p>Laurence emphasizes, that sarif does not mix up message and codeflow, but keeps this separate</p>
<p>Michael and Laurence suggest to showcase a visual studio plugin that works on message presentation of that "stuff" (scribe only crude sketching)</p>
<p>David: <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/57" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/57</a></p>
<p>All discuss the region issue</p>
<p>Laurence: suggests to discuss offline with Michael to reach consensus before discussing in TC</p>
<p>Laurence: <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/blob/master/Documents/ChangeDrafts/sarif-v1.0-issue-57-61-embedded-link-and-region-specifier.docx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/blob/master/Documents/ChangeDrafts/sarif-v1.0-issue-57-61-embedded-link-and-region-specifier.docx</a></p>
<p>Action on Michael and Laurence to discuss above link target</p>
<p>All discuss</p>
<p>Jim: asks, if SARIF already has a list of locations?</p>
<p>Laurence: A result object specifies a single location where detected, but the SARIF result may list all locations of that finding (e.g. partial class)</p>
<p>Laurence: mentions as second kind of location the code flows -- a sequence of locations that the tool steps through to detect the result.</p>
<p>Laurence: Third zero or more related locations may be stated</p>
<p>Jim: referred to all of these three kinds</p>
<p>Michael: There is a unique ID concept in SARIF for this: it is the URL</p>
<p>Michael: The rest of the locations could refer to that.</p>
<p>All discuss on how a consumer has an easier task, when providing a direct URL instead of a reference e.g. 701 and then look that up.</p>
<p>Discussion continues on embedded links versus related locations concept</p>
<p>Paul: Thanks for a great discusssion. (as he has to drop off)
<p>Michael: summarizes his understanding of possibilities of current proposal as possibly allowing to remove related regions if users fall in love with URI everywhere ...</p>
<p>Laurence: thinks this should not indicate removal of related regions</p>
<p>Jim: also thinks these remain useful</p>
<p>Michael: dislikes about related regions, as it is not clear where to anchor the referring / relations in all cases</p>
<p>All discuss</p>
<p>Stefan: - # 61 - <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/61" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/61</a></p>
<p>Laurence: suggests to construct a parallel document with a competing proposal</p>
<p>Michael: relates the current discussion to  3.4 Consider restructuring SARIF to be location, not results-focused #55 <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/55" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/55</a></p>
<p>MichaelTake feedback and make a finished proposal for URL protocol to add a fragemtn for a region</p>
<p>MichaelAlternatively add a fragment to target locations</p>
<p>Paul and Yekatarina to provide samples for documenting their use of markup</p>

<h3 id="7.3">7.3 Consider adding 'rank' or 'probability' property # 58 <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/58" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/58</a></h3>
<p>Michael: summarizes the issue</p>
<p>Jim: has one concern for rank info go into the property bag, might lose some info for context</p>
<p>Michael: suggests that we could use namespace tags as prefix to resolve collisions, Jim is in fear of</p>
<p>Michael: thinks, that if one can map rank into 0 or 1 value, this could lead to inclusion of the proposal</p>
<p>Laurence: thinks, it is not good to put a reserved property name into the spec, when it is well defined, as this should end up as a first class element.</p>
<p>Michael: confirms, that rank is strictly for sorting, not for certainty</p>
<p>All discuss on recoverable certain semantics when aggregating multi tool results</p>
<p>Laurence: <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/48" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/48</a></p>
<p>Stefan: Summary: "End-to-end results management concepts"</p>
<p>Mel: rank and probability are not of much use in this context, but more confidence (from the tool)</p>

<p>No other business</p>
