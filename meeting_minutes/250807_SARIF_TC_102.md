1. Started to prepare a issue freeze for 2.2 list:
- https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aneeds-attention

The editors would love to plan for the September Editor revision to become a CSD01/CSDPR01.
For that we may need to move some unevolving 2.2.0 candidate issues out of scope.
A short triage talk over the issues in above filter (that do not yet have an implementatble proposal or a pull request) is more than welcome.

2. Created change-set [Fixed example 1 in 3.13.5 inline external properties #727](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/pull/727)
    - the editors kindly request approval by the members of the TC to merge into the SARIF v2.2 spec editor-revision-2025-08-07.

    - the editors kindly request approval by the members of the TC to merge into the SARIF v2.2 spec editor-revision-2025-08-07.

4. Created change-set [Simplified sarif schema path #730](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/pull/730)
    - the editors kindly request approval by the members of the TC to merge into the SARIF v2.2 spec editor-revision-2025-08-07.

5. Created change-set [Updated version and schema values in various examples #731](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/pull/731)
    - the editors kindly request approval by the members of the TC to merge into the SARIF v2.2 spec editor-revision-2025-08-07.

6. Created [Editor Revision 2025-08-07 #725](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/pull/725) as collection of the change-sets 2. - 5.
    - the editors kindly request approval by the members of the TC to merge into this SARIF v2.2 editor-revision-2025-08-07 into the main branch
      as preparation for the future editor-revision-2025-09-11.
