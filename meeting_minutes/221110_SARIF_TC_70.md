  * No news

# 4. Discussion

## 4.1 Review status on finalizing SARIF 2.1 errata [List of next steps - github issue #509](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/509)

* Mary: Received email on what to work on and hopes to have more report on progress next meeting
* David: Thanks Mary for volunteering to edit

## 4.2 Review current state of ecosystem ongoing work

* Mary:
  * Elixir based SARIF tool added
  * New round of VS Code advanced security features published and the team is eager for feedback
  * There are suggestions to migrate SARIF JSON schema file in a minor version bump to adhere to a newer standard version and therefore collect a list of non-breaking changes to accomplish that
  * Update relevant to the C# SARIF SDK to enable big integer support
  * Microsoft continued to a dedicated typescript SARIF SDK and invites anyone on the TC with strong interest on typescript as co maintainers on the repository to contact Michael or Mary

## 4.3 Review outcomes of subgroup discussions

None noted

## 4.4 Discuss end-to-end results management

* Mary: Presented a video from Chris Meyer demonstrating two changes to the Visual Studio SARIF Viewer targeting the interop with Github advanced security features
* All discuss use cases and implications of the demo
* Discussion continued how specifically the connection between the SARIF Viewer and github advanced security works
* Discussion continued on how to note and convey context with and in addition to SARIF
* Charles notes the presence of CSAF and VEX - use cases like participant A finds vulnerability with tool C but participant B uses another build target so that the vulnerability does not apply to her - how to combine read-only documents with actionable advisory functionality
* Stefan suggests to explore [Common Security Advisory Framework CSAF v2.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/csaf-v2.0.html) (currently on [ballot for OASIS Standard](https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/voting/ballot.php?id=3732))
  as to what this format and toolscape might offer for an extended SARIF:
  * Discoverability - well-known URLs, ROLIE feeds, specifc roles like trusted providers, aggregators, etc.
  * Navigation - product trees, links to mitigations, problem analysis, history of analysis,
  * Advisory - what to do with the findings in an actionable automated way
  * Mixing-in read-only parts and adding specific authoritative parts for a resulting CSAF document across origins
* Stefan: Full disclosure that he is one of the editors of that OASIS CSAF specification
* Current blog post from CISA "[Transforming the Vulnerability Management Landscape](https://www.cisa.gov/blog/2022/11/10/transforming-vulnerability-management-landscape)" as of today might help provide context
* Other aspects like how general Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) formats in general might provide benefit within the ecosystem also discussed

## 4.5 AVCDL and SARIF (Charles)

* Charles walks all through a [presentation of AVCDL](https://github.com/nutonomy/AVCDL) and relates to SARIF
* Charles provided the presentation as [PDF for archival in the OASIS kavi system after the meeting as email to the TC list](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/sarif/202211/msg00005.html)
* All discuss the topics presented especially how to compose and how (with the given elements noted) to represent processes like
  * Threat Modeling
  * Fuzz Testing
  * Dynamic Analysis
  * Penetration Testing
