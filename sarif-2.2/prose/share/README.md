# SARIF v2.2 Prose - User Facing Delivery Items

This `share` folder provides the user facing delivery items we build from the sources in the `edit` folder.

First we generate an experimental "GFM + cosmetics" format file - a.k.a. the "Elephant".

During the editorial phase of the v2.2 life cycle the HTML and PDF delivery items will be added too.
