#### 3.3.1.4 Added related locations property

PR#643 [Added related locations property (#491)](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/pull/643)

* labesl: design-approved, proposal, to-be-discussed
* opened: July 09, 2024 by editors
* implements:
  * IS#491 [Suggestion: Add a relatedLocations property to notification objects #491](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/491)
    * labels: 2.2.0, design-approved, proposal
    * opened: May 13, 2021 by Henry Mercer
* changeset discussion on GitHub:
  * feedback:
    * Kalle Olavi Niemitalo (public stakeholder): 
      * For the `result` object, the `relatedLocations` property is specified with MAY rather than SHOULD:
      * >A `result` object **MAY** contain a property named `relatedLocations` whose value is an array of
        zero or more unique ([sec](#array-properties-with-unique-values)) `location` objects ([sec](#location-object))
        each of which represents a location relevant to understanding the result. 
      * If a SARIF producer is outputting a notification that does not have any related locations,
        do you want it to output an empty array `"relatedLocations": []` or omit the property altogether?
  * response[1].editor:
    * Interesting point. I will add the property to the object "of this task" as non-required but I propose to the
      TC to discuss the consistency of requesting the same property in two different places and tow distinct compliance levels.
      > Personally I expect JSON instances to omit keys in case the values are empty containers or otherwise would be `null`
      if the schema allows. A schema should serve the communication of instances and not the other way around.
      Providing noise when there is no information to convey should only be required on grounds of real use cases where that actually help(ed).
    * @Co-Chair - Propose to be discussed in the TC meeting 2024-07-11
  * response[2].editor:
    * after looking at our schema file again: When the default of an array value is the empty value and the key to that value
      is not in the required array of the "holding" object, my understanding is, that a consumer seeking information on
      that key SHALL use the empty array regardless if it was present in the consumed JSON instance.
      ... and the producer may or may not insert such noisy nothingness.
* suggested next steps: discuss consistency, eventually change compliance level to `MAY`, approve and merge
