# 3. Discussion

## 3.1 Review recruitment effort to complete the technical committee

* OASIS plans to set up a time so prospective members can meet with David
* OASIS is happy because SARIF TC attracted so many new members this year already.
* Day before Yesterday JFrog joined OASIS with the intent to join SARIF TC
  - hopefully next SARIF meeting will have first participants from JFrog.

## 3.2 Review status on finalizing SARIF 2.1 errata [List of next steps - github issue #509](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/509)

* David reports on status of production and kindly requests review from members
  - There is a mapping from sections to issues in [David's latest comment on the tracking issue 509](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/509#issuecomment-1104673114)

## 3.3 Review current state of ecosystem ongoing work

* Chris reports there is progress further supporting the eco system

## 3.4 Any continued report/discussion on metrics

* Nothing new on metrics

## 3.5 Review crash data proof-of-concept

* Chris provides several demos online to the participants - all of them are open source 
  - Microsoft Visual Studio integration from GitHub Advanced Security [https://github.com/microsoft/sarif-visualstudio-extension](https://github.com/microsoft/sarif-visualstudio-extension)
  - VSCode extension including analysis of threads [https://github.com/microsoft/sarif-vscode-extension](https://github.com/microsoft/sarif-vscode-extension) and this "extension of the extension" includes pop-ups with markup (provided by the XAML tools)
* Chris demonstrates how "drift of source locations" during edit sessions where the developer moves sources parts relevant to "findings" in the SARIF files and regardless the "code finder" still allows to link the new location to the "old" findings
  - VSCode API driven feature that profits from properties in the SARIF file
* Michael reminds on the past discussions within this TC on CodeQL vs. IDE APIs to achieve consistent behavior
* All discuss APIs, injection of XAML markup per SARIF, user experience when providing pop-ups on hover, and authentication support for plugins/extensions per tool (Visual Studio vs. VSCode)
* Jeff Williams suggests to put the complete context inside SARIF (not only HTTP but also databases some code is connecting to)
* Aharon suggests to extend SARIF with the context (esp. the control flow graph) and not only rely on the vendor to prioritize what goes into from context
* Nathan suggests ranking to sort out context display ordering
* All discuss how SARIF may provide useful metadata and how to find a domain agnostic limit
* All thank Chris for the interesting demo

## 3.6 Status of Wikipedia page

* David: Still ongoing

## 3.7 Discuss end-to-end results management (including code insights protocol)

* Nothing specific today

# 4. Other Business

* Opportunity to enter liaison with the Open Source Security Foundation [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org) because OpenSSF seems to mention SARIF a lot (as noted by Chet Ensign from OASIS)
  - Could be individual or companies being members of both sides
  - There would be a permanent agenda item on the liaison
  - If an individual does the liaison we could have that person reporting to both sides
  - If a company would offer the liaison different people might report to the respective parties
* All discuss the possibilities and implications of entering a liaison with OpenSSF
* Michael would also be interested in liaising with NIST, DHS, etc.
  - maybe GitHub would be the natural candidate as liaison

## 5.1 End debate of other issues by 10 minutes prior to scheduled meeting end and follow the agenda from this point (Co-Chair Keaton)

## 5.2 Review of Decisions Reached (Secretary Hagen)

## 5.3 Review of Action Items (Secretary Hagen)
