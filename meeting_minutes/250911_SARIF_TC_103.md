>
> For instance, in a TC in which there are 20 Voting Members, at least 11 must vote "yes" for a motion to pass.
>
> Certain actions are identified in the TC Process as requiring a Full Majority vote:
>
> - \[...]
> - election of a Chair or Co-Chair
> - \[...]
>
> A Technical Committee has the option of using either the OASIS groupware system or email to run an electronic ballot.
> It must be noted, however, that all electronic ballots must be open for at least 7 days.
