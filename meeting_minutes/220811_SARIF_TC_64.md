  * WIP

# 4. Discussion

## 4.1 Review status on finalizing SARIF 2.1 errata [List of next steps - github issue #509](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/509)

* Michael: Some changes in support from the side of Microsoft but we will move on (docs support)
* David: Kindly asks to convey thanks to Courtny for doing such a great job.

## 4.2 Review current state of ecosystem ongoing work

* Mary: Working on better support in Visual Studio for general SARIF support
* Mary: POC requested for result source efforts
* Mary: Working on fixes

## 4.3 Discussion of updates to SARIF web site [https://www.sarif.info](https://www.sarif.info)

* Mary: We did update the website
* All: Walk through the website
* Mary: Includes renaming of collaborators that changed name (Whitesource is now Mend), added Java links, etc
* David: Wikipedia reviewers have been rejecting the current draft because many links point to source code sites and it seems that would require too much effort for reviewers to vet the relation
* Michael: Assumes the references mostly point to github source code sites instead of OASIS links.
* Pavel: Proposes in terms of process to follow the reviewer suggestsion to have an undebated version publicly available and add the removed content in different form later
* Michael: Is convinced that we may have misinterpreted the reviewer feedback
* David: Kindly asks for additioanl references
* Michael: requests an action on him for that

## 4.4 Review outcomes of subgroup discussions

* Mend members met with Chris Meyer to support completing the auto-fix scenario

## 4.5 Discuss end-to-end results management (including code insights protocol)

None

## 4.6 Roadmap review

* Michael: Suggests we review the existing roadmap and move on to further specific topics
* Michael: Internal discussions he participated in focus mostly on security related analysis
* Michael: Likes to ask the group if there is interest and support for exploring security related topics
* Stefan: Suggests to explore our possible contributions to an actionable security ecosystem as the security tech offering TCs to him look more like "many fences, only few farmers"
* Stefan: An example https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=csaf where a lot of integration and extension has been achieved including CVE, CPE, TLP, VEX, SBOM (spdx, cyclonedx, swid)
* Michael: Some links associated to the suggested partners, existing work, etc.:
  * https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti-cybox
  * https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro.html
  * https://github.com/CybOXProject/schemas/blob/master/objects/Win_Executable_File_Object.xsd#L612
* Michael: Three main dimensions he sees as important in the security arena and aligned with our existing and possible future contributions:
  * Raw telemetry
  * Standards for analysing the data and reaching conclusions
  * How to deidentify the data for sharing or long term use  
* Jeff: 
  * The data has to come together - for now SARIF cannot provide it yet, but it seems to be possible to align a slightly extended SARIF with surrounding devices to achieve some of it
  * To summarize: SBOM looks good, SARIF looks good, but these are more ornaments and not yet the whole tree the security industry needs
  * Integrations points?
* Stefan: Sees only possible way to go per extension / integration points but we should plan twice the effort: One part to come up with suggestions and the other to defend the simplicity of such "intrusion" points
* David: Suggests someone should ideally prepare a page accessible to boost the discussion on that topic over the next meeting
* Michael: Suggests to formulate the strengths of SARIF to prepare for integration / extension point negotiations
* Jeff: Kindly requests an action on him to provide that seed page David hinted at.  

## 4.7 SBOM/other standards

* Jeff: Thinks SBOM was already touched at the end of the previous section
* Michael: Kindly asks if Stefan could transform his decade long experience at OASIS into a short writeup who would be probably relevant as contact partners
* Jeff: Might already have such similar lists / overviews but thinks these lists might be short
* Nathan: 
  * Open Telemetry already defines the relationships already that could also be a contact point for that list (cf. eg. https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/span-general/#source-code-attributes)
  * Mostly any offering that already offers graphs to navigate the information and relations (cf. eg. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview)
* Michael: The tool owners in this TC should all be interested in having devices to provide vulnerabilities in a connected world (example credential exposure, how to actionably support such incidents / findings)
* Jeff: Interpretability for consumers of the security information
* Stefan: For software to describe findings, interpret, and act upon them there are different aspects [note: missing list added after the meeting]:
  * state: development, test, deployed, deprecated, deactivated, (removed)
  * shapes: source vs. binary
  * provenance: original, third-party (resolving the full tree down to "originals"), ambiguous (multiple versions in separate "compilation" units of some "tool")
  * vulnerability: Describing what exactly is the defect / finding in terms the recipient understands (may change over time!)
  * impact: (As Jeff said:) interpretable info of what it may cause in a way that enables the recipient of the information can act upon
  * mitigations: Are mitigations known and can the recipient of the information apply them
  * exploitability: Are there known exploits of which kind (automatic, proof of concepts, theoretical)
  * different interests: Vendors / suppliers and customers are only aligned per minimal enforcable regulations competing brand damage (too late not the full information) with risk reduction (enable the recipient to assess their "own" risk)
  * reliability: actual vs. declared state (by someone on the internet: project declares MIT, but the tree has GPL in it, or outdated versions, ...)
  * and some more like dimensions noted in Common Vulnerabiliy Enumerations (CVEs)
* David: Kindly asks Stefan to put the list into a github page to also foster future discussion
* Michael: Should we start a subgroup (schedule meeting for mid next week) to support the harvest of relevant attachment points to support Stefan (Michael proposes to take notes)
