## 4.5 Review Roadmap

* Michael: 7 topics identified within TC
  1. Close Wikipedia page and errata
  1. Review non-breaking changes for an incremental release
  1. SARIF eco-system advances that serve TC members / others (fixes)
  1. Reference implementations for fingerprints, REST API, SARIF-as-SQL, etc.
  1. Exploring deep topics at the "edges" of SARIF, e.g. results management
  1. Scaling (large files), signing, and encryption
  1. Broad advances into new topics, e.g. dynamic analysis
* Michael: 1 or more topics possibly outside of the TC
  1. New initiatives
* Charles: Is interested in pushing topic 7. "Broad advances into new topics, e.g. dynamic analysis" such that we extend SARIF and avoid having other standards copy part of SARIF to cover these new topics
* All discuss
* Stefan and David remind, that we can do many things within the identified topics with only extending the charter (no re-chartering needed) but we decided to await the errata submittal to OASIS and then update the charter based on the currently envisioned roadmap
* Michael: Suggests that he tries to build out the above items and present during next meeting an extended version as a seed for a modified charter 
* David: All guiding mission statements we receive from members should end up in the github for future reference
* Stefan: Just let us ensure that these statements do not constitute substantial contributions - the latter shall be submitted as OASIS kavi documents to ensure TC admins can ensure IPR compliance along the process
