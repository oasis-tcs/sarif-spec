* David: Suggests to directly create a branch and send an email with the URL
* Michael: Will store in microsoft OneDrive and manage access - so as to make comments visible (as the document is a Microsoft Word document no markdown)
* David: When this review is approved by the reviewers we should hold a full majority vote and hand over publication to OASIS TC administration.

## 3.3 Review current state of ecosystem ongoing work

* David: Merged the [PR#2](https://github.com/dmk42/sarif-spec/pull/2)

## 3.4 Discuss metrics

* All discuss metrics representations
* Michael suggests for next meeting to 
  - keep agenda items 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 and 
  - change the item 3.4 to "Discuss metrics specifically CodeQL, Metrics Investments, and General design approach"

## 3.5 Discuss dynamic analysis and how to address it

* David: Reminds everyone what was last time decided to proceed in that order:
  - publication of Errata for 2.1 
  - rechartering of TC to widen scope
  - there will be a specific list needed for the new charter
* Michael: Let us start a collection of domains
* David: Domain fuzzing
* Michael: Domain test execution and colocate with code coverage
* Paul: Domain crash dump analysis? Or too close to fuzzing?
* Michael: Supports adding the crash dump analysis explicit
* Katrina: Out of scope runtime analysis
* Stefan: Domain memory analysis (forensics of file less malware more observing)?
* Stefan: Out of scope dynamic effects on CPUs (think rowhammer)
* Michael: Out of scope Penetration Testing
* Michael: Out of scope Jupyter Notebooks/threat intelligence sharing
* Michael: Domain web scanning, client and server scanning (accessibility)
* Michael: Domain Compile time (address sanitizer) and run time insertion points (managed debug)
* Michael: Out of scope: license defect in repository or dependency on component that has a CVE
* Paul: These are mostly static analysis outcomes; question: If a dynamic feature has a correspondence to a static feature we do not include, should we include the dynamic feature?
* Michael: Verify that we include no general "suurounding" system analysis
* Michael: Code Insights - related to an MS effort to project crash info on a source code view
* Michael: Google and Uber have defined the Code Insight Protocol
* Michael: Where in the graph of all possible analysis types and tools we do see SARIF?
