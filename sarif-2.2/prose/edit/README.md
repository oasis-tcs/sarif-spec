# Place to edit the prose

Per sites like github many users are used to see markdown like documents rendered directly online (UX).

To optimize the reading experience but also support a maintainable and consistent editor experience (DX) suggests to keep the editor source versions in a different place.

This way we can slice and dice well-sized and coherent parts of the prose and minimize workarounds that enable the online rendition for specific processors (like those in use at bitbucket, codeberg, github, gitlab, or sourcehut).

The editors will want to ensure consistency with the related SARIF schema set revision, the examples, as well as other terms and statements within the prose text of initially 12000 lines.
