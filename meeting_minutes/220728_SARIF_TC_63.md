# 4. Discussion

## 4.1 Review status on finalizing SARIF 2.1 errata [List of next steps - github issue #509](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/509)

## 4.2 Review current state of ecosystem ongoing work

* SARIF viewer/SDK bug fixing on going.
* Demo prepared for 'rerun analysis'
* CWE taxonomy authoring in flight.

## 4.3 Discussion of updates to SARIF web site [https://www.sarif.info](https://www.sarif.info)

* All images obtained, being incorporated currently.
* Web site update and ready to show by next committee meeting.

## 4.4 Review outcomes of subgroup discussions

* No offline subgroup discussions occurred.

## 4.5 Discuss end-to-end results management (including code insights protocol)

* Mary demonstrates the end-to-end demo for rerunning analysis.
* Michael asked about settings persistence, Pavel says per-session too frequent, save them once per exe location. Put them in VS global settings as user-level settings.
* We should unify VS and VS code UX.
* Nathan: VS code has security prompts, repurpose that language. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust.
* Complete a privacy/security review.
* Can we add something explicit to queue up a local installation?
* Sync the repo, download the tool, build appropriate build, configure the build, invoke the tool. What about runtime conditions for the repro (environment variables, etc.)? Perhaps we should integrate with test code.
* https://github.com/features/codespaces could be used to provide a fix ready repro environment.
* How portable can SARIF be? Mike says there are slots for everything but the standards are different.
* Jeff says you can't deliver all the context/richness, it would be a great contribution but it looks very ambitious.
* Jeff says reproducibility is key. This would span many domains in addition to security.
* 'No repro' is death to fix rates/tool uptake, is ParaSoft working on this? Perhaps we follow up with them.
* Jeff says can we cover a subset, simple local tools, what about docker, can we grow into a larger standard?
* Thanassis: let's be willing to grab 80% of the problem.
* What about RR (time travel debugging) actually not large data, there is a replay mechanism here. Is there a data format we can inspect?
* Jeff: shall we make SARIF open/extensible? and get collaborators, make it crowd-sourcable?

## 4.6 Final decision on migration of the SARIF GitHub repository from master to main [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/renaming-a-branch)

* Microsoft supports the change
* Aditya notes the change should be seamless if we follow the GitHub branch rename process.
* Paul Anderson provides support
* Pavel doesn't perceive the value but will support it.
* Stefan believes it's good to rename but would prefer a more precise/descriptive name other than main.
* We can create arbitrary stable references to 'main' by using tags.

# 5. Other Business

* Wikipedia entry in draft, was declined, need for official citations cited as reason. David to follow-up. 
* How does SARIF interact with other SBOM standards? Should we compare/contrast? Can SARIF fit into it?

## 6.1 End debate of other issues by 10 minutes prior to scheduled meeting end and follow the agenda from this point (Co-Chair Keaton)

* ACTION on David to keep pushing to close on the wikipedia page
* ACTION on David to provide the required OASIS links for stable references of TC repository artifacts
* ACTION on Mary to continue to develop fixes scenario
* ACTION on Mary to finalize web site changes and ship them
