<p>Members of the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/sarif/">OASIS Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF) TC</a> create and manage technical content in this TC GitHub repository ( <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec</a> ) as part of the TC's chartered work (<i>i.e.</i>, the program of work and deliverables described in its <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/sarif/charter.php">charter</a>).</p>

<p>OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work">GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work</a>, are governed by the OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process">TC Process</a>, <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr">IPR Policy</a>, and other policies, similar to TC Wikis, TC JIRA issues tracking instances, TC SVN/Subversion repositories, etc.  While they make use of public GitHub repositories, these TC GitHub repositories are distinct from <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories">OASIS Open Repositories</a>, which are used for development of open source <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses">licensed</a> content.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The purpose of the SARIF TC is to define a standard output format for static analysis tools, which will be called the Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF).  <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec">This GitHub repository</a> supports development of the draft SARIF standard. Requests for modification should be made via <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues">Github Issues</a>.</p>

<p>A static analysis tool is a program that examines programming artifacts in order to detect problems, without executing the program. Software developers use a variety of static analysis tools to assess the quality of their programs. To form an overall picture of program quality, developers must often aggregate the results produced by all of these tools. This aggregation is more difficult if each tool produces output in a different format. A standard output format would make it feasible for developers and teams to view, understand, interact with, and manage the results produced by all the tools that they use.</p>

<p>Submission <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/TCADMIN-2759">request</a> from David Keaton (SARIF TC Co-Chair): we expect to populate this repository from the existing one found here: <a href="https://github.com/sarif-standard/sarif-spec">https://github.com/sarif-standard/sarif-spec</a>.</p>
