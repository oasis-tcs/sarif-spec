# Safety, Security and Data Protection

All safety, security, and data protection requirements relevant to the context in which SARIF documents are used MUST be translated into,
and consistently enforced through, SARIF implementations and processes.

> Eyample: Data protection requirements together with best practices rule and guide the handling of sensitive data in SARIF reports.

SARIF documents are based on JSON, thus the security considerations of [cite](#RFC8259) apply and are repeated here as service for the reader:

> Generally, there are security issues with scripting languages.  JSON is a subset of JavaScript but excludes assignment and invocation.
>
> Since JSON's syntax is borrowed from JavaScript, it is possible to use that language's `eval()` function to parse most JSON texts
> (but not all; certain characters such as `U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR` and `U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR` are legal in JSON but not JavaScript).
> This generally constitutes an unacceptable security risk, since the text could contain executable code along with data declarations.
> The same consideration applies to the use of eval()-like functions in any other programming language in which JSON texts conform to
> that language's syntax.

In addition, SARIF documents may be rendered by consumers in various human-readable formats like HTML or PDF.
Thus, for security reasons, SARIF producers and consumers SHALL adhere to the following:

- SARIF producers SHOULD NOT emit messages that contain HTML, even though GitHub-flavoured Markdown is permitted.
  To include HTML, source code, or any other content that may be interpreted or executed by a SARIF consumer,
  e.g. to provide a proof-of-concept, the issuing party SHALL use Markdown's fenced code blocks or inline code option.
- Deeply nested markup can cause a stack overflow in the Markdown processor [cite](#GFMENG).
  To reduce this risk, SARIF consumers SHALL use a Markdown processor that is hardened against such attacks.
  **Note**: One example is the GitHub fork of the `cmark` Markdown processor [cite](#GFMCMARK).
- To reduce the risk posed by possibly malicious SARIF files that do contain arbitrary HTML (including, for example, `data:image/svg+xml`),
  SARIF consumers SHALL either disable HTML processing (for example, by using the `--safe` option in the `cmark` Markdown processor)
  or run the resulting HTML through an HTML sanitizer.
- To reduce the risk posed by possibly malicious links within a SARIF document (including, for example, `javascript:` links),
  SARIF consumers SHALL either remove all actions from links (for example, by displaying them as standard text)
  or render only those actionable that are known to be safe (for example, determining that via the media type).
- `externalPropertyFileReferences` MAY allow confidential data to be read from JSON files to which the SARIF producer does not have access.
- In an `artifactLocation` object, the `uri` property MAY point to a file outside the expected directory tree,
  e.g. "file:///etc/passwd" when the actually analysed files are in a disjoint directory tree.
  In this case, `fix` objects MAY propose edits to such an out-of-tree artifact.

SARIF consumers that are not prepared to deal with the security implications of formatted messages SHALL NOT attempt to
render them and SHALL instead fall back to the corresponding plain text messages. As also any other programming code can
be contained within a SARIF document, SARIF consumers SHALL ensure that none of the values of a SARIF document is run as code.
Moreover, it SHALL be treated as unsafe (user) input.

> Additional, supporting mitigation measures like retrieving only SARIF documents from trusted sources and check their integrity
> before parsing the document SHOULD be in place to reduce the risk further.

The distribution requirements of SARIF data allow to specify domains as the value of the HTTP header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.
While a wildcard (`*`) as header value usually prevents implementing browsers from sending credentials during the CORS request,
the restriction to specified domains often enables sending credentials.
Allowing several specified domains results in using dynamics on the server, which can widen the attack surface by using more code and configuration.
Furthermore, this might reveal information about internal structures, e.g. which domains are allowed to send credentials, or which tools are used.
Given that credentials from a browser are a potent tool in the event of an attack, restricting the origins seems to imply a higher risk and
therefore less secure than allowing all domains without credentials.

As setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header potentially allows for cross site request forgery,
it SHOULD only be served on files and directories containing SARIF data.
For any restricted feeds, standard authentication methods SHOULD be used that are not send by web browsers if the wildcard is used as header value.
