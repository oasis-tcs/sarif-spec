Type name: application

Subtype name: sarif+json

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: UTF8 only
	
Security considerations:

- The use of absolute paths in analysis result location URIs might reveal sensitive information about the machine on which the scan was performed.
- The use of the hostname component in analysis result location URI might reveal the network location of the machine on which the scan was performed.
- The use of raw HTML in message strings expressed in Markdown might allow arbitrary code execution (for example, through javascript: links).
- The use of deeply nested constructs in Markdown message strings might lead to stack overflow in some Markdown implementations.
- Certain properties of the SARIF object model might reveal information about the machine on which a scan was run. (The specification allows such properties to be omitted or "redacted".)
- Certain properties of the SARIF object model (such as the command line that invoked the analysis tool) can contain arbitrary commands which might damage a machine on which they are run.
