# 3. Discussion

## 3.1 Review current state of ecosystem ongoing work

### 3.1.1 Related activities (OPENSSF, etc.)

* No news

### 3.1.2 Other Ecosystem Items

* Michael notes GitHub is discussing dynamic validation again
* Nathan:  
  * reports that in his absence, his team has provided some examples of OpenTelemetry observability
     * this may be interesting for how we think about this long term
  * he and his team also plan to file 5 – 7 spec proposals
* David Malcolm:
  * GCC has posted a way to lift its SARIF export capability into a shared library (GPL licensed)
  * Michael asked to be kept informed of this work

## 3.2 Review outcomes of subgroup discussions

* No news

## 3.3 Discuss the list of small, non-breaking changes for SARIF v2.2

 * Discussion of markdown and whether it warrants re-versioning
   * David Malcolm: we should create a markdown form of 2.1 before authoring 2.2
     * Michael agreed
   * Michael: typically, a standard/API wouldn’t be versioned if the only change is refactoring docs/specese (with no material changes)
   * David Keaton takes an action item to see where OASIS stands on fast-tracking docs changes
     (with minimal/no material churn in meaning/API/etc)
 * SARIF 2.2:
   * Michael provides reminders of existing SARIF properties, level, rank, default configuration
   * Aditya presents on precision (a measure of engine accuracy), and proposes four levels, low, med, high, very high
   * Precision is a specific sorting scenarios for customers and CodeQL does emit all levels and UX utilizes these categories at GitHub
   * Michael: what about likelihood? Other values?
   * Aditya: these are not the provenance of a tool, they are computable only with external context
   * Yekaterina:
     * OpenText supports accuracy, confidence, probability, impact and others. A final aggregated number is stored in `result.rank`
     * There is a distinction between engine precision and rule precision for MicroFocus tooling
   * Aditya: in CodeQL, only one
   * Michael proposes we resolve discussion with a `severity` and `precision` property,
     each of which have four levels, low, med, high, and very high
   * Nathan: concerns about `security-severity` but will follow up offline via GitHub issues
   * Some discussion around whether to express CVSS in the format
   * Conclusion in discussion is that this computed value isn’t strictly owned by/originates with the tool,
     therefore, it is less appropriate to include in the SARIF standard

## 3.5 Review Roadmap [Future.md](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/blob/main/Future.md)

  the roadmap document [Future.md](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/blob/main/Future.md) per pull request
