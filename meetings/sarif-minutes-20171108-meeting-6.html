  <li># 33 - <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/33" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/33</a></li>

</ol>
<p>Michael: now discussing issue #33</p>
<p>Laurence: suggests, he sends a mail to the group, that includes two sample fragments showing the competing suggestions clarifying which one was Jims suggestion</p>
<p>Paul: describes what their tool relies on w.r.t. formatting of messages / elements used etc.</p>
<p>Yekatarina: shortly describes her contribution to the discussion in the issue (a screenshot and a link where people can inspect online)</p>
<p>Michael: noted a strong similarity between the two samples posted</p>
<p>Michael: thinks some more regions of the structures possible, should additionally be documented in use - he knows of some sophisticated tools that do - so we have more coverage before deciding</p>
<p>Laurence: suggests to in any case focus on the restriction, as we already narrowed down in discussion on some restriction on markdown, but in any case implementers will require to create parsers for a custom format which will not be great for adoption, so are we all conscious of the possible impact on adoption?</p>
<p>Michael: welcomes the thought direction of first identifying a base among the group but then again think about impact on secondary dimensions. He suggests to continue, but then let the ecosystem decide how to proceed. If we only use a subset, anyone supporting markdown today, would they have to support a second parallel way to integrate SARIF?</p>
<p>Paul: notes, that we should conclude on what we expect from the consumers to rendered what in how far: is a newline rendered or ...? We have to describe the expectations, so that implementers can offer similar experiences / renderings</p>
<p>Michael: agrees with that and proposes we build a foundational consensus here from that concept</p>
<p>Laurence: on question on encoding, he thinks it is not a problem, as JSON is to be encoded in UTF-8 or another 16-bit Unicode variant.</p>
<p>Laurence: is in favour for mandating a format statement (markdown subset)</p>
<p>All discuss markdown and responsibility of input validation or constrained subset</p>
<p>Stefan: suggests that encoding of JSON files might need future discussion, esp. when read from disk (file) or received over wire.</p>
<p>Luke: asks about format</p>
<p>Michael is fully volunteering to collect the groups opinion snapshot via a straw man poll )mailing list)</p>
