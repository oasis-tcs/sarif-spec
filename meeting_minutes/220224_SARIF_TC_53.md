# 3. Discussion

## 3.1 Review recruitment effort to complete the technical committee

* David: Good support from OASIS coming up

## 3.2 Review status on finalizing SARIF 2.1 errata [List of next steps - github issue #509](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/509)

* David: Courtney uploaded a new revision in the issue per https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/509#issuecomment-1039350887 as https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/files/8062707/sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-csd01-Changes.docx
* David: Kindly asks the members to review the new revision before next meeting
* Michael: Should we add a revision history entry in the document?

## 3.3 Review current state of ecosystem ongoing work

* Eddy: 
  * GitHub provided most used languages and tools lists - that includes security and linters (anything that can produce results from users)
  * Integration of AzureDevOps/GitHub within the IDEs per SARIF - two proof of concepts.
  * Current PoC extension was successful and these changes will be added to the VS/VSCode extension.
* Michael: 
  * The GHAS (GitHub Advanced Security) is also including linters. Greatly extending the list of candidate projects to add SARIF export, author corresponding GitHub actions.
  * There are now fifty or more entries on that list.

## 3.4 Any continued report/discussion on metrics

* Michael:
  * Will provide a pull request for a schema extension
  * Kindly requests members to provide real world examples of any format today that packages metrics data
* Nathan: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/metrics/
* Paul: Will share some Code Sonar metrics reports
* Aditya: Provide comprehensive CodeQL metrics
* Thanassis: Does profiling or performance information also count as metrics?
* Michael: 
  * Domains are still under discussion
  * Heat map, flame graph data etc. may be out of scope
  * Summarizing information of call statistics may be in scope (all up to discussion)
  * Code Insights Protocol (CIP) might be a focus point for defining the extent of metrics scope
* Stefan: As long as we end up with domains that are numbers or categories i.e. leading to aggregates and trends and no free text

## 3.5 Review proposal for what's in- and out-of-scope - general discussion

None - but keep item for future discussions

## 3.6 Status of Wikipedia page

* David: Has been granted a Wikipedia account and can continue to upload.

## 3.7 Discuss end-to-end results management (including code insights protocol)

None

# 4. Other Business

* Michael: 
  * Suggests considering setting some specific gaols for the next steps of standard evolution
    * Initial simple candidate sources for dynamic analysis (scenarios):
      * Crash reports
      * Fuzzing
      * Telemetry
    * More scary sources
      * Web endpoint scanning
      * Accessibility
  * Example: Next two weeks try to tackle the above steps in order?
* Nathan:
  * Works with crash reports - typically more than a single stack how a specific crash or "class" of crash can occur
  * Many internal and external tools produce results in very similar form for the crash reports (related to CIP)
  * All stored in static location similar to typical SARIF (local) storage model
  * Interested in seeing how a remote storage approach would look like - alignment with source repository storage
  * Explains the current approach to telemetry exploration within his team
    * Broad brainstorming like approach and
    * Specifically guiding developers e.g. hinting at 
      * not only creating telemetry, but also 
      * monitoring and using the data (observability) 
* Michael: Plans to provide results from his, Nathan's, Eddy's team and others in two weeks time
* All discuss crash report and telemetry integrations
* All discuss how information of several crash reports is typically projected into buckets for guiding developers and that this is strongly tool dependant
* Michael: Reminds on how SARIF extended the use cases as interchange format across boundaries (between tools)
* Stefan: 
  * When we have the first content ideas / models for crash and telemetry data inclusion, then 
  * we should evaluate the following aspects:
    * composing (how can the diverse tools access elements for projecting and aggregating)
    * writing (latency and throughput)
    * remote storing and retrieving (discovery and addressing)
    * reading (latency and throughput)

# 5. Resolutions and Decisions reached (by 10 minutes prior to scheduled meeting end)

## 5.1 End debate of other issues by 10 minutes prior to scheduled meeting end and follow the agenda from this point (Co-Chair Keaton)
