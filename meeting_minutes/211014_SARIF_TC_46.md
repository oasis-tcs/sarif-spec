# 3. Discussion

## 3.1 Discuss dynamic analysis and how to address it

* What to address
  * Michael suggests expanding the scope, keeping the brand
  * Stefan seconds to expand the scope, provide software instead of static coverage, but keep SARIF as an acronym/brand
* Expand the scope of our TC, keeping the SARIF name?
  * Stefan imagines a new spec even call SARI describing either both or only dynamic analysis 
  * Paul is in favor to keep one standard to cover the full (extended) scope to avoid divergence
  * Michael supports compatibility to the existing offering, sees both possibilities of
    * either separate new spec
    * or one combined as long as no disruption of existing implementations
  * Katrina thinks, the two types of analysis are different to an extent to over compliacte any spec that tries to describe both on low level
  * Katrina suggests to maybe create a high level integrational spec and two low level specs interworking based on that umbrella spec
  * Michael embraces the concept of focused and cohesive specs
  * Eddy suggests to tackle the work and see how it evolves
  * All are in favor of ensuring participants for both types of analysis should be on the committee
  * Michael mentions from his experience the narrowing on work items that happens in practice and highlights the interchange function of SARIF
  * Paul makes the point that many use cases profit from the interplay of static and dynamic analysis and the report will target the same recipients
  * David states that split standards will not necessarily be separated per static versus dynamic, but eg may split based on being able to link to source code or not
* Create a new TC with a new name?
  * No one spoke in favor of creating a new TC regardless of the fact that this means the TC will keep the part Static in its name
  * Stefan sees the proposal from Katrina as promising candidate to not disrupt but also standardize static and dynamic analsis interachange best
    * As long as the umbrella "meta" standard is lean and mean like a pair of cherries model:
      * The high level is just the "branch" holding together the two cherries static and dynamic - like an interface
  * Eddy, Katrina, Michael, Paul, and Stefan are in favor of keeping the TC and extend its scope
  * David understands and agrees with that the TCs remains unchanged but extends the scope
    * First it best helps focus resources on the work itself
    * Second there is no real benefit from changing the TC ()
  * David suggests to wait until publication of Errata to SARIF v2.1 and then do the rechartering
    * All agree
