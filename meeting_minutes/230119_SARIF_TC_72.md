* Thanassis is happy to further support the TC work via meetings and GitHub collaboration - prefers 6 weeks between meetings
* Michael suggests to solve errata and wikipedia progress per GitHub issues etc
* Nathan targets to provide around September 2023 design recommendations fot the TC in case the evaluations are complete until then 
* Michael is OK with design goal exploring and ecosystem work and meeting frequencies between monthly or quarterly
* David suggests conduct discussions per the mailing list to include everyone
* Yekaterina agrees with Thanassis that small things can be achieved via e-mail/github; as for bigger stuff like directions needs more discussion among the members
* All discuss
* Mary shares the results of the mission statements from members (Set of questions sent around in 2022) 
* Mary will send to the TC mailing list
* David suggests to place the document into the TC kavi as a contribution
* Thanassis asks how SARIF fits into the design space of solutions around analysis: Are we collaborative, are we more shift left or right, more a developer workflow close to IDE or closer to systems integration and reporting
* Michael assesses SARIF as primarily until today close to developer workflows but lately the TC has considered expanding to optimize the overall life cycle tasks: alert systems, remote storage, etc.
* Michael sees two options to continue enhancing the tooling and integrations as well as possibly defining a more wide scope like eg expanding to more dynamic analysis use cases also
* David sees a continued interest in continuing the TC business
