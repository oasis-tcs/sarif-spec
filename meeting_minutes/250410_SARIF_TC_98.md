# 3. Discussion

## 3.1 SARIF TC Charter Clarification for 4-year charter reaffirmation process [Draft](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/72698/)

> We are required to reaffirm our charter every four years.
> We may choose to take this opportunity to clarify it to embrace more than just static analysis.
> This was discussed with Chet a while back,
> and he suggested we do this as a clarification instead of a rechartering.
> We are NOT allowed to change the name of the TC,
> or make substantive changes to the scope or deliverables.

### 3.4.1 Editor's report

- Revisited tool to drive extrraction and boilerplate injection of examples
  - Parasited the repository of examples issue from David Malcolm to note in
    [comment](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/677#issuecomment-2790533985)
    >> In addition, we already have an extract of examples from the SARIF prose at/below 
    >> [/sarif-2.2/prose/edit/src/json-examples](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/tree/main/sarif-2.2/prose/edit/src/json-examples)
    >The algorithm for extracting an "completing" the prose embedded examples was mainly:
    >
    >1. extract the snippet under a local derivable name that should avoid collisions with other examples by 
    >   construction and without knowledge of the effective section numberings.
    >2. remove the right margin comments identified by a hash character outside of any string member values.
    >3. inject pseudo members clearly exposing the ellipsis from the prose embedding as value string and a 
    >   coded auto-serialized key. 
    >   These members either injected directly or as members of an injected object as context dictates.
    >4. and some hacks I have forgotten in the year that passed since the extraction.
    >
    >I used the extraction to fix the many nits that many examples had, making it hard as they were to be
    >useful resources for copy-paste trial coding implementers.
