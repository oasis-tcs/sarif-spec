## codeFlow object

### General{#codeflow-object--general}

A `codeFlow` object describes the progress of one or more programs through one or more thread flows, which together lead to the detection of a problem in the system being analyzed. We define a thread flow as a temporally ordered sequence of code locations occurring within a single thread of execution, typically an operating system thread or a fiber. The thread flows in a code flow **MAY** lie within a single process, within multiple processes on the same machine, or within multiple processes on multiple machines.

### message property{#codeflow-object--message-property}

A `codeFlow` object **MAY** contain a property named `message` whose value is a `message` object ([sec](#message-object)) relevant to the code flow.

### threadFlows property

A `codeFlow` object **SHALL** contain a property named `threadFlows` whose value is an array of one or more `threadFlow` objects ([sec](#threadflow-object)) each of which describes the progress of a program through a single thread of execution such as an operating system thread or a fiber.
