* Chris: solicit OSS linters burndown progress. IDE problems identified, turnaround time and code drift during code authoring. Mike to contact Thanassis offline to provide information on the VS Code extension. 
* Thanassis suggests that we use the OASIS repo as a starting point for information. Where are the assets? The blessed libraries? Etc. Links to the Wiki, etc. 
* Nathan: Nathan's project has worked on the code drift issue MF to follow up offline. 
  * Considering putting SARIF on XML configuration files as well, incidentally. 
  * For results store, let's get concrete. 
    * 1) Let's create issues. 
    * 2) Create a point area for this planning. 
    * 3) the REST API is most important and s/be prioritized in design, 
    * 4) the tabular form is important but less important. Nathan should contribute a use case as a start, MF and team to contribute others. 
* Known SARIF rendering clients are VS, VS Code, OSS web control, GitHub Advanced Security.
