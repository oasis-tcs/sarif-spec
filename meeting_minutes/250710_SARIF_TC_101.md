- David Malcolm: Walks all through his reported issue
  [Seeking clarification on: locationRelationships within a graph node's location #712](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/712)

> "2.5 Commonly used objects" defines "theResult" as "The result object (§3.27) containing the object under discussion.refers to "
>
> FWIW In GCC's I have `class sarif_location_manager` as a base class for locations and notifications.
>
> Suggest we add something like "theLocationOwner"
> see also https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/712 : what about locations in nodes in graphs in run graphs?
- Co-Chair David: Can we maybe add a visual representation of the syntax?  
- Stefan: Can we add a YAMLish display of the syntax as a minimal example in the issue?
- Charles: If it is not forbidden, implementers can do it. location.id in the context of a run may be useful or maybe null; pure documentation issue?
