## reportingDescriptorRelationship object

### General{#reportingdescriptorrelationship-object--general}

A `reportingDescriptorRelationship` object specifies one or more directed relationships from one `reportingDescriptor` object ([sec](#reportingdescriptor-object)), which we refer to as `theSource`, to another one, which we refer to as `theTarget`.

`reportingDescriptorRelationship` objects appear as elements of the `reportingDescriptor.relationships` array ([sec](#reportingdescriptor-object--relationships-property)). The `reportingDescriptor` object containing this property is `theSource`.

`reportingDescriptorRelationship` objects are useful in various scenarios:

1.  In relating analysis rules to taxonomic categories ("taxa"; see [sec](#taxonomies)).

> EXAMPLE 1: In this example, the definition of rule `CA1000` states that every result that violates this rule falls into the taxonomic category ("taxon") specified by ID 327 of the Common Weakness Enumeration \[[CWE](#CWE)\]:

2.  In relating one analysis rule to another.

> EXAMPLE 2: In this example, the definition of rule `CA1000` states that every violation of this rule will lead to a violation of rule `CA2000`.

### target property{#reportingdescriptorrelationship-object--target-property}

A `reportingDescriptorRelationship` object **SHALL** contain a property named `target` whose value is a `reportingDescriptorReference` object which identifies `theTarget` (see [sec](#reportingdescriptorrelationship-object--general)).

### kinds property{#reportingdescriptorrelationship-object--kinds-property}

A `reportingDescriptorRelationship` object **MAY** contain a property named `kinds` whose value is an array of one or more unique ([sec](#array-properties-with-unique-values)) strings each of which specifies a relationship between `theSource` and `theTarget` (see [sec](#reportingdescriptorrelationship-object--general)). If `kinds` is absent, it **SHALL** default to `[ "relevant" ]` (see below for the meaning of `"relevant"`).

When possible, SARIF producers **SHOULD** use the following values, with the specified meanings.

- `"equal"`: `theTarget` identifies essentially the same set of items as does `theSource` (for example, a taxonomic category that identifies the same set of results as this rule).

- `"superset"`: `theTarget` identifies a superset of the items identified by `theSource` (for example, a taxonomic category that identifies a superset of the results identified by this rule).

- `"subset"`: `theTarget` identifies a subset of the items identified by `theSource` (for example, a taxonomic category that identifies a subset of the results identified by this rule)

- `"disjoint"`: The sets of items identified by `theTarget` does not intersect with the set of items identified by `theSource`.

- `"incomparable"`: The sets of items identified by `theTarget` intersects with the set of items identified by `theSource` but is neither a superset nor a subset.

- `"canFollow"`: Items identified by `theTarget` can be caused by, or occur downstream of, items identified by `theSource`.

- `"canPrecede"`: Items identified by `theSource` can be caused by, or occur downstream of, items identified by `theTarget`.

- `"willFollow"`: Items identified by `theTarget` will be caused by, or occur downstream of, items identified by `theSource`.

- `"willPrecede"`: Items identified by `theSource` will be caused by, or occur downstream of, items identified by `theTarget`.

- `"relevant"`: `theTarget` is relevant to `theSource` in a way not covered by other relationship kinds.

If none of these values are appropriate, a SARIF producer **MAY** use any value.

> NOTE 1: Although `"relevant"` is a catch-all for any relationship not described by the other values, a producer might still wish to define its own more specific values.

> NOTE 2: The values `"equal"` and `"superset"` are special in that they allow certain elements of `result.taxa` ([sec](#result-object--taxa-property)) to be elided. See [sec](#result-object--taxa-property), paragraph 2, for more information on this point.

### description property{#reportingdescriptorrelationship-object--description-property}

A `reportingDescriptorRelationship` object **MAY** contain a property named `description` whose value is a `message` object ([sec](#message-object)) that describes the relationship.
