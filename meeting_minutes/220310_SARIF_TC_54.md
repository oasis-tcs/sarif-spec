# 3. Discussion

## 3.1 Review recruitment effort to complete the technical committee

* David: Received quite some OASIS requests to meet with interested parties for joining the TC
  * Appointment March, 21st with JFrog

## 3.2 Review status on finalizing SARIF 2.1 errata [List of next steps - github issue #509](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/509)

* IN PROCESS

## 3.3 Review current state of ecosystem ongoing work

* Chris: Major work on Visual Studio and VS Code extensions

## 3.4 Any continued report/discussion on metrics

* Michael: Will inspect the samples Paul sent per email to the TC list

## 3.5 Review crash data proof-of-concept

* Michael: Next time a demo will be available

## 3.6 Status of Wikipedia page

* David: for progress cf. actions of previous meetings section

## 3.7 Discuss end-to-end results management (including code insights protocol)

* Michael: Learned about the Code Insights Protocol (CIP) history - essentially that this is more a sketch
  * Also shared info on the [MagpieBridge](https://linghuiluo.github.io/MagpieBridge-ECOOP19-Talk.pdf) (another sketch of other authors from a 2019 paper) 
  * Comparing to Language Server Protocol (LSP) - a real existing protocol (in production)
* Nathan: Interaction between SARIF and LSP might be beneficial albeit difficult to create initially.
* Paul: SASP did not evolve since approx. 2019, but he is happy to think about how to integrate or what use cases it might bring
* Nathan: Has seen not much standardizing besides Test Anything Protocol (TAP) https://testanything.org 
* Stefan: Like with TAP streaming capability would be helpful - use case: 
  * fan out the analysis tasks to N nodes
  * receive back in N streams
  * triage the problematic reports
  * not have to wait until complete test reported (like junit.xml)
  * mostly thinking on fuzzing - where you never know when and what you get back
* Nathan: 
  * that streaming use case is a lot like the remote storage interface concept
  * there is not even a file concept in the current analysis techniques used by them
  * shares a link to a 2021 paper [Estimating Residual Risk in Greybox Fuzzing](https://mboehme.github.io/paper/FSE21.pdf) by Marcel Böhme, Danushka Liyanage, and Valentin Wüstholz
* Thanassis: 
  * Had a similar use case of background testing and these results could be communicated async and 
  * would be nice to be able to aggregate for cumulative visualization for developers
  * many developer use cases (not sure if these are all in scope for SARIF)
* All discuss "fair game" targets for SARIF
  * Michael:
    * Work Items
    * Auditing and Evidence
  * Stefan:
    * Fuzzing - dealing both with high initial influx and low exponential decay later
  * Thanassis:
    * Async static analysis results maybe including accumulation
