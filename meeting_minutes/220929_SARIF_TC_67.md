# 4. Discussion

## 4.1 Presentation of runtime-specific data (Thanassis)

* Presentation of runtime data by Thanassis. 
  * Thanassis walked through the Mayhem Heroes program and his team's experience of adding security scanning and SARIF reports to over 1,000 GitHub projects and how it relates to the ecosystem.
  * Shared a few thoughts with the group:
  	* Consuming SARIF reports just as important (or more!) as creating them
  	  * aggregation, longitudinal trends, branching key for understanding (parallels with issue mgmt)
  	* Bringing this back to the developer necessary for maintenance
  	  * automation, closer to testing frameworks, integration with dev tools
  	* Is a clean SARIF report associated with quality
  	* Responsible disclosure flows for OSS
* Nathan:
  * Mentioned similar issues related to how to do integrations with issue management and automatically create issues in Azure DevOps through .sarif file rules.
  * Tooling is not currently publicly available.
  * Added that .editor configuration files can also be used for the same role and there is room for synergy there between editors and pipelines.
*	Thanassis pointed out some of the lack of quality reports for SCM projects based on SARIF report contents.
* Nathan pointed out that this is typically part of Governance and Group policy and some teams have solutions for automatically capturing defects of certain types and preventing builds when these occur. No commonly available solution/standard exists here.
* Charles Wilson:
  * Pointed out that we have not yet succeeded in equating a clean SARIF report with quality.
  * Sometimes warnings are ignored (otherwise they would be errors!) and it is difficult for developers to trust SAST findings.
  * Discussion followed on how dynamic analysis findings can be more reliable.
  * Last, Charles pointed out a gap in SAST results on the system of systems space and how SARIF findings for the overall system can be very hard to communicate to individual teams and developers for resolution.

## 4.2 Review status on finalizing SARIF 2.1 errata [List of next steps - github issue #509](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/issues/509)

* David reporting SARIF 2.1 errata: ongoing - no new updates

## 4.3 Review current state of ecosystem ongoing work

* Mary 
  * VS Code extension has the automatic pulling of results from codeQL, what was shown in demos is released.
  * Demo that was shown last week for C++ compiler work has an associated published blog post. 
  * Several bug bashes with Nathan Baird for latest releases of Visual Studio extensions.
